      "**An Aside:** I originally wrote this as just a massive brain dump but in retrospect, it wasn't helpful at all. In the process of preparing a presentation for PyATL, I decided to rewrite it to be much more informative and less example heavy. The original post was essentially just a series of examples of *how* you'd use decorators or *what* you'd use them for rather than *why* you'd use decorators and addressing patterns. I'm hoping this rewrite clarifies that instead of being a \"Look at all this code you probably don't understand!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Decorators are well championed but most posts I've seen about them don't address many of the issues here. I wouldn't say they're something beginner or novice friendly since it delves into concepts like functional programming and \"higher order functions\" which is just scary talk for \"functions that accept functions as arguments\" and even currying, which basically boils down to \"reducing the number of inputs a function takes.\" I'm grossly over simplifying here for the sake of explaination, but I stand by these simplifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another note, apparently there was a lot of hemming and hawing in the Python mailing list when this construct (for lack of a better word) was introduced because of confusion with the decorator design pattern. Given that design patterns aren't my strongest suit (at least in terms of knowing exactly what each does and how to best implement it), I think there's quite of bit of one-to-one between the two on a basic level. Each take in an object and modifies it in a way that the original shouldn't be worried about. The decorator pattern seems to be more concerned with adding data or processing information and is compositional whereas Python's decorators seem to be more about removing logic that, yes, is associated with the object in question but doesn't need to be mixed directly with the actual logic of the object. That makes it sound very confusing, but hopefully that will become clear through examples and explaination."

That's really all there is to first class functions, they are treated just the same as anything else in the language. And since methods are simply functions attached to a class or object, the same applied to them as well. `str.join` is just as first class as `map`."
