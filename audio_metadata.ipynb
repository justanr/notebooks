      "You're probably familiar, at least in passing, with the concept of metadata. It's data about data. In terms of audio files, it's things like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Bitrate\n",
      "* Duration/Length\n",
      "* Artist\n",
      "* Album\n",
      "* Track Position (if available)\n",
      "* Year released (if available)\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I'm using [TinyTag](https://github.com/devsnd/tinytag) (`pip install tinytag`) to extract metadata (and TinyTag only supports this), but there's a whole plethora of libraries to extract and set audio metadata:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Mutagen [docs](https://mutagen.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) [source](https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen)\n",

      "I actually don't spend a terrible amount of time on actually pulling the metadata out. It's extremely straightforward with TinyTag. I spend more time with processing and massaging that data into information we can really work with. I revisit the cacheing decorator from the decorator post (and don't follow much of my own advice -- it's kind of a do as I say, not as I do sort of thing, even then I'm not even really giving that great of advice) as well as improving on the Artist/Album/Track mock data models from the API post as well. There's also a little bit about recursively walking directories and selectively looking for the files you want."

In this particular instance, it's faster than os.walk but I've always thought benchmarks are useless without a greater context -- so for shits and giggles, I ran both over my Music directory (with all 26,000+ files), just spitting values into 0 length deque, and my walk function took about ~560ms, os.walk took ~350ms.
