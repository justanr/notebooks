      "In the [last post](http://justanr.blogspot.com/2014/09/descriptor-day.html) about descriptors I introduced the concept of building an observer pattern with descriptors, something Chris Beaumont almost teases with in his [Python Descriptors Demystified](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/ChrisBeaumont/5758381/descriptor_writeup.ipynb). But, I feel he left a lot on the table with that concept.\n",

Put plainly, your subject shouldn't have hard coded logic to call to specific observers. Rather, you should be able to register instances of observers onto an object (or class) and have it call out to them programmatically.\n",

In other cases, the goal could be to have \"anonymous\" observers -- objects that are created and immediately injected into the framework rather than assigned to a name and passed in.
