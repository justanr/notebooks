      "One common thing I've used a few times is using `str.format` to create formatting metapatterns -- essentially a format pattern that becomes a format pattern when formatted. I'm not necessarily advocating for using this everywhere, but it's handy sometimes.\n",

      "Part of a Python learning group gives homework, one of the \"assignments\" was to pad an input to an arbitrary amount with an arbitrary character. The \"cannonical\" example given was to pad a given number to five characters with zeroes. Formatting ahoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind how closures work: When we call `padder` we're actually creating an *\"instance\"* of `pad` where the pattern is bound at the time of creation. The way this metapattern works is that `{{}}` will actually output `{}` when passed through formatting, so assuming defaults, the metapattern ends up looking like: `{:0>5}`."

      "I've been using this in OpenWebAmp's (nee FlaskAmp) models for easy recognition of model instances in the command line shell. Basically, all of my main objects have a `id` and `name` fields, but some don't and I need more information from others. Creating a generic `__repr__` method isn't very intuitive given how much attributes in objects can vary. Essentially what this does is look for `__repr_fields__` in an object (using sane defaults if not present) and then iterates through that creating a list of patterns like `['id={id}', 'name={name}']` and then joins them into a single string, then formats it and then formats that into *another* pattern. What pops out the other end is something like this: `<Artist id=1 name=The Foo Bars>`.\n",
