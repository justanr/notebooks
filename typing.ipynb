    "So [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) is a thing. It's about type hinting in Python and seems to be heavily influenced by mypy-lang. However, this isn't a *type system*. It's meant as a helper for static code analysis. There's no type enforcement -- at least to my understanding. Basically, we'd be able to load up pyflakes or PyCharm and receive information on what the parameters are expected to be or if at some point we've got a type mismatch.\n",
