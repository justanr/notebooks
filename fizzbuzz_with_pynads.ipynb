However, we have to teach Python how to use a placeholder and silently step it out of the way when a real value comes along. I suspect that this is similar, maybe, to how Haskell handles it, but I've not dug at all."

There's also `pynads.utils` if you need to plumb some of the internal workings like compatibility (did I mention all the tests pass 3.4 and 2.7?!) or how monoids are determined on things that aren't explicitly monoids."

And maybe Monad Transformers if I work the gumption up for it (probably yes). And who knows what else."
