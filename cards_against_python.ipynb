      "Cards Against Humanity is a pretty awesome game, especially if you're friends have a dark sense of humor and optionally beer. Think of it like Apples to Apples for horrible people. If you've never heard of either of them, I'd recommend picking them up.\n",

      "The rules for these games is pretty simple:\n",
      "\n",
      "* You have two types of cards: Black and White for Cards Against Humanity, Red and Green for Apples to Apples\n",
      "* Each player draws a hand of white or red cards\n",
      "* Each player takes a turn as the judge of the round, who draws a single black or green card\n",
      "* The other players play a card or cards from their hand\n",
      "* The winner gets the black/red card, players draw cards and the next player becomes the judge\n",

      "---------------\n",
      "It's always best to start with your basic bits. At least that's how I look at it. In this case, it's the cards. Since cards never change, it's best to model them with an immutable data type. Tuples are the most obvious choice, but card[0] is less descriptive than card.text, so collections.namedtuple is a better choice."
