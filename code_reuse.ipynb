Here, we're going to use two decorators Python provides in the standard library called `total_ordering` so we can sort our Row objects and the other is the `property` decorator which allows us to retreat a function as if it were an attribute (via the [descriptor protocol](http://justanr.blogspot.com/2014/09/descriptor-day.html) which is a fantastic code reuse ability that I won't explore here)."
