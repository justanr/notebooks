    "[Flask-Restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.2/) is a great library that builds on top of Flask's MethodView and makes it pretty easy to support multiple API styles (XML, CSV, JSON, etc). It ships with JSON serialization by default, leaving the others up to the user to implement. There's a bunch of other features as well, but I'm only to tread on the incredibly useful routing mechanism in place here.\n",

Changing the routing from vanilla Flask routing to class based is a little weird at first, but it quickly becomes very intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
